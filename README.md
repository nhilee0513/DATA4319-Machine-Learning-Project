# DATA4319-Machine-Learning Project
The purpose of this repository is storing all my project for the DATA 4319 - Machine Learning class for FALL 2020 teaching by Dr. Davila, Randy. This is not to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That's why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.

### The Components of Learning

Supervised Learning
Unsupervised Learning
Semisupervised Learning
Feasibility of Learning
Measuring Error

## Supervised learning: Where the model uses labeled target data to make predictions
- Decision Trees and Regression Trees
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression                
- The Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
- Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression
- Neural Nets


### Unsupervised learning: Where the model identifies patterns without any labeled target data
- Clustering
- The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Probabilistic Clustering
- Autoencoding

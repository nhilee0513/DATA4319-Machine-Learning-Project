# DATA4319-Machine-Learning Project
The purpose of this repository is storing all my project for the DATA 4319 - Machine Learning class for FALL 2020 teaching by Dr. Davila, Randy. This is not to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That's why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.
## Supervised learning: 
 - Where the model uses labeled target data to make predictions
## Unsupervised learning: 
- Where the model identifies patterns without any labeled target data

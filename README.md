### The Components of Learning

- Supervised Learning
- Unsupervised Learning
- Semisupervised Learning
- Feasibility of Learning
- Measuring Error

### Supervised learning: Where the model uses labeled target data to make predictions
- Decision Trees and Regression Trees
- Linear Regression
- Gradient Descent & Logistic Regression                
- The Perceptron Learning Algorithm
- K-Nearest Neighbors Algorithm
- Neural Networks


### Unsupervised learning: Where the model identifies patterns without any labeled target data
- Clustering
- The K-Means Clustering Algorithm
- Hierarchical Clustering
- Probabilistic Clustering
- Autoencoding

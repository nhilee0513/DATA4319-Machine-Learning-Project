# DATA4319-Machine-Learning Project
The purpose of this repository is not to implement machine learning algorithms by using 3rd party library one-liners but rather to practice implementing these algorithms from scratch and get better understanding of the mathematics behind each algorithm. That's why all algorithms implementations are called "homemade" and not intended to be used for production.

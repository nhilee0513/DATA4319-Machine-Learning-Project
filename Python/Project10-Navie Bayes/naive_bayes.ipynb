    "Naive bayes is simple classifier known for doing well when only a small number of observations is available.The Naive Bayesian classifier is based on Bayes’ theorem with the independence assumptions between predictors. A Naive Bayesian model is easy to build, with no complicated iterative parameter estimation which makes it particularly useful for very large datasets. Despite its simplicity, the Naive Bayesian classifier often does surprisingly well and is widely used because it often outperforms more sophisticated classification methods. "

This is not as much of a problem for our classifier as you might think. Why? Because we don’t care what the true posterior value is, we only care which class has a the highest posterior value. And because the marginal probability is the same for all classes 1) we can ignore the denominator, 2) calculate only the posterior’s numerator for each class, and 3) pick the largest numerator.
